# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#                Poly = Many

#               TWO WAYS TO ACHEIVE POLYMORPHISM
#               1. Inheritance = An obejct could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#               2. "Duck typing" = An object must necessary attributes/methods
